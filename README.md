# video_summary_generaton
This repo contains the Pytorch implementation of the AAAI'18 paper - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Unsupervised Video
Summarization with Diversity-Representativeness Reward. The original implementation:  https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/pytorch-vsumm-reinforce

The repo contains 2 files.
1) training.ipynb
2) testing.ipynb

Please assign the path of training data set to the variable 'input_videos_folder' in training.py.The program will preprocess the data and 
will generate model.

Please assign the path of testing data set to the variable 'input_videos_folder' in testing.py and provide path of the model generated during training.The summary will be generated in a separate folder 'summary_videos'.
